# PlateMath
PlateMath iOS Application

This application was designed to help lifters focus on what they do best, lift weight. Plate math can be tricky, especially after you have done a heavy set. Errors in plate math can lead to the incorrect weight being loaded on the bar.

To help lifters, this program shows visually how many of which plate should be loaded.

Options for bar weight and collars allow accurate calculations.

The lifters can update the availability of plate pairs in the setting screen. 

_Currently this applications only caters for metric weights. I know this is upsetting to some people, but all powerlifting federations use metric units as the standard of measurement_

*Having said this, if enough people request it, imperial units can be considered in the future*
